### Car Rental System â€“ C++ Project

This is the C++ Car Rental System project we were assigned to complete.  
In this project, we aimed to create a fully functional yet simple system that demonstrates the practical use of core C++ programming skills.

## Project Goals

## We tried to:

- Build a simple and clear car rental console application
- Practice and demonstrate the use of:
  - Structs
  - Arrays or Vectors
  - Functions
  - Conditional and looping structures
  - Console control with `system("cls")` and `system("pause")`

## How It Works

The program starts with a **main menu** where users can choose their role:

## Customer
- View available cars
- Choose a car to rent
- Enter the number of days to rent
- See rental confirmation and total price

## Manager
- Monitor all cars
- View rental status
- Add new cars to the system (array/vector)
- Requires password login (`abel01` or `miki02`)

---

 ## Technical Details

- Built using the **Dev-C++ compiler**
- Uses:
  - `struct` to store car data
  - `vector` to manage car lists
  - Multiple `functions` to keep the code modular
  - `system("cls")` to clear the screen
  - `system("pause")` to hold output before exiting
