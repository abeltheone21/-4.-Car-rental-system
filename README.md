-4.-Car-rental-system
This is the C++ Car Rental System project we were assigned to complete.  In this project, we aimed to create a fully functional yet simple system that demonstrates the practical use of core C++ programming skills.
What we try to do with this  Project 
The program starts with a main menu that lets the user choose their role
Customer side: If the user selects Customer They can view available cars, Choose a car to rent,E nter the number of days they want to rent the car, Get a simple output showing their selection and confirmation
And the Manager side: allow the  manager to monitor, manage  the cars, and add new cars to the array
How it works
The system is built  using the Dev-C++ compiler
The program uses:
Try to utilize logical operators and looping conditions  to check conditions and looping conditions for running the code multiple times
uses Arrays (or structs) to store car information 
used multiple Functions to keep the code organized and easy to read
tried to use system("cls") to clear the screen and make the console net and organized so it would not be cramped
 we tried  to use system("pause")` to hold the output before the program ends
